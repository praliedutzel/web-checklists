# web-checklists
A collection of checklists for web design and development projects.

I'll be using this repo to store checklists I am using/have used for various web projects. Everything is organized into folders based on the type of checklist it is for. Comments, questions, or suggestions? Feel free to create a pull request or [tweet me](https://twitter.com/praliedutzel) suggestions.
